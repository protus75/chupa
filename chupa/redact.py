"""Redaction seam (CHUPA_PLAN.md section 6): one shared filter every captured-stream writer is built with.

Writer-site checklist (extend in the same change that adds a writer of a captured stream):
- attempt-spool writer: chupa/driver.py `Spool`
- engine-log writer: chupa/enginelog.py `EngineLog`
- attempt-spool writer: chupa/providers.py `CliAdapter.invoke` (prompt, cli event stream, stderr)
- journal writer: chupa/journal.py -- NOT YET WIRED; its one secret-bearing producer, the LLM effect
  result, is scrubbed before it becomes the completion record (chupa/llmeffect.py `llm_call`)
- harvest serialization: not built (Phase 2)
