"""Effect primitive (CHUPA_PLAN.md section 6): once-per-key against the surviving journal.

Once is COMPLETION-keyed: a key with a journaled completion replays its recorded
result. An intent with no completion (crash mid-effect) re-executes here on
purpose -- that window belongs to reconcile-on-entry (section 11), not this
primitive. A completion may carry a `cost` body field: the ledger folds it (D3).
