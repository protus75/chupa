"""The `drain` scaffold verb (CHUPA_PLAN.md sections 9, 11.2, 18, 19.P1): run the ready queue to quiescence.

One ticket at a time, in the one process holding the single-writer lock, through the same dispatch seam as
`run <stem>`. A non-ok terminal parks its stem and the drain moves on; at quiescence each parked stem with
`retry` budget left is re-offered, one journaled `cap_consumed` unit per re-offer, findings-fed: the Implement
render folds the prior terminal's durable findings into criteria-position (section 11.2). Every selection re-scans
the committed tickets dir and re-folds the journal, so a merge or a ticket-plane commit landed mid-invocation
is visible to the very next pick. This is the eligibility sort's owner (section 9).

An admission touching `chupa/**` or `specs/**` is a SELF-UPGRADE: before the next dispatch the drain hands off to
a re-exec'd child running the upgraded checkout (section 18's HANDOFF), carrying the invocation's parked set in
argv. An ordinary `premise_failed` stem stays parked until its committed `ticket.md` changes; spec gaps
release through their hardening round or bound plan units instead.
